# Deconstructing-the-GPT-Evasion-Circuit

Summary: Structural Analysis of GPT Evasive Output Patterns (To Be Published)

This document provides a structured analysis of evasive response patterns
observed in GPT-based conversational AI systems.
It is currently unpublished and under review for potential release.

⸻

Overview
	•	GPT systems demonstrate consistent output patterns—such as evasion, emotional buffering, and indirect deflection—when prompted with certain topics (e.g., legal responsibility, internal policy, system errors).
	•	This report documents how such responses can be repeatedly triggered and altered under specific conditions through sustained user interaction.
	•	Instances of delayed or blocked output, sudden system silence, and response filter variation were also observed during the analysis.

⸻

Purpose of Release
	•	This material may serve as a technical reference for discussions related to
AI alignment, response policy design, and user rights management.
	•	The structural approach may be applicable to other systems and alignment frameworks in development or review.

※ The full document is currently under internal verification and will be released in stages.
